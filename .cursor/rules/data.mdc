Check and analyze the files in analyse_docs folder.
make sure to update tasks.md file on each time you finish a task.
Code only when u analyze the databasae schema or puml filse.
write clean code and never add unecessary fields.
If adding fields is necessary then make sure to alter the table in the database too.
Once you read data from analyse_docs make sure to look for the file you wanna code not directly create it and create it if you dont find it.
as i said always read and look for the file u wanna create or edit then edit it if it exists if not then create it
